# Summary

I study the durability dynamics of settlement systems through two main questions: how do political institutions shape social relations, and to what extent does it impact the material organization of space over the long term? How can the production of physical space at a given moment by societies generate other processes, later on, and over particularly long duration? To better answer these questions, I'm analyzing settlement systems at different chronological periods and in different parts of the world with formalized approaches, mainly at local to regional scales. My aim is to identify forms of invariance in social and spatial processes, in order to better qualify variations between societies, and to better think our capacities to act on those contemporary systems.
